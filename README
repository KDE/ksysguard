This CVS version of KTop is work in progress! Although I only try to
check in reasonably stable versions, I cannot guarantee this. I
typically develop on SuSE Linux 6.0 with 2.2 kernel. If your system is
different, this program might not even compile.

If you want to join this development please contact me first. Please
do *NOT* check in unsolicited code as I might am rearranging the code
and merging becomes a real headache so your code will be lost.

This does not mean that I don't appreciate your help. Especially
porting to other platforms is difficult for me. I have introduced a
nice interface so porting is fairly easy. See OSStatus.cpp if you are
interested. I really like to have a Solaris 2.x and HPUX 7 port!
